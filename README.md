# Food-Ordering-Website
A food ordering website made using Java, JDBC, Servlet, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and mysql.

I create this project after complition of my java full statck training to understand the concepts. The aim to create this webpage is to use, all the three tiers i.e, the presentation tier or user interface; the aplication tier, where data is processed; and the data tier, where the data associated with the application is stored and managed.

i will now walk you through the different webpages and features of the website. All the images used for the project were copyright free when I used them. If they do belong to someone let me know and i will remove them.

# Login Page
This is a simple Login form which is created using the HTML for frontend and uses 'post' method to pass on the form values to LoginCheck.java for validating login. If the user don't have an existing account then they can also rgister a new account.
